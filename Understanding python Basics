## Python in Data Analytics

Data analysts use Python across every step of the data analysis process:

- **Data Gathering:** Tools like **BeautifulSoup** and **Scrapy** help analysts scrape and collect structured data from websites efficiently.

- **Data Processing:** Libraries such as **Pandas** allow analysts to organize, manipulate, and perform calculations on large datasets using DataFrames.

- **Data Visualization:** Python's visualization libraries like **Matplotlib** turn raw numbers into charts, graphs, and interactive visuals that support clearer insights and better decision-making.

## Data Types and Variables

Variables are names that store data values. They act as containers that hold information, and the stored value can change during the program. Data types tell Python what kind of information a variable is holding.

### Commonly Used Data Types

#### 1. **int (Integer)**
Whole numbers with no decimals. They can be negative or positive.

```python
age = 30
```

#### 2. **float (Floating-Point Number)**
Numbers with decimals. In analytics, floats appear in averages, percentages, prices, measurements, sales amounts, and statistical calculations.

```python
price = 499.99
```

#### 3. **str (String)**
Text data enclosed in quotes. Essential for text analysis in analytics.

```python
customer_name = "Alice Johnson"
```

#### 4. **bool (Boolean)**
Data types with only two possible values: `True` or `False`. Mainly used in decision-making, filtering data, or checking conditions.

```python
sales = 15000
is_high_value = sales > 10000  # returns True
print(is_high_value)
```

#### 5. **list**
Stores multiple values in a single variable. Created using square brackets `[ ]`. Lists are **ordered** and **changeable** (mutable).

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
```

#### 6. **tuple**
An ordered collection that is **unchangeable/immutable**. Once created, you cannot change its elements.

```python
coordinates = (10, 20.7)
```

#### 7. **dict (Dictionary)**
A collection of key-value pairs. Each key is unique and acts like a label. Created with `{ }`.

```python
employee = {
    "name": "James",
    "age": 28,
    "salary": 85000.50
}
```

#### 8. **set**
A collection of unique items. Unordered and mutable. Created using `set()` function.

```python
numbers = set([1, 2, 3, 2, 4])  # Output: {1, 2, 3, 4}
```

## Operators

Operators are used to perform operations on values and variables. Essential for calculations, comparisons, data filtering, and logical operations in analytics.

### 1. Arithmetic Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `+` | Addition | `a + b` |
| `-` | Subtraction | `a - b` |
| `*` | Multiplication | `a * b` |
| `/` | Division (always float) | `a / b` |
| `//` | Floor Division (integer result) | `a // b` |
| `%` | Modulus (remainder) | `a % b` |
| `**` | Exponentiation | `a ** b` |

**Example:**
```python
sales_today = 300
target = 250
if sales_today >= target:
    print("Target achieved!")  # True
```

### 2. Comparison Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `==` | Equal | `a == b` |
| `!=` | Not equal | `a != b` |
| `>` | Greater than | `a > b` |
| `<` | Less than | `a < b` |
| `>=` | Greater or equal | `a >= b` |
| `<=` | Less or equal | `a <= b` |

### 3. Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `and` | True if both conditions are True | `a > 10 and b < 20` |
| `or` | True if at least one condition is True | `a > 10 or b > 20` |
| `not` | Inverts the condition | `not(a > 10)` |

**Example:**
```python
age = 25
income = 50000
if age > 18 and income > 30000:
    print("Eligible for loan")
```

### 4. Assignment Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `=` | Assign | `a = 10` |
| `+=` | Add & assign | `a += 5` → `a = a + 5` |
| `-=` | Subtract & assign | `a -= 2` |
| `*=` | Multiply & assign | `a *= 3` |
| `/=` | Divide & assign | `a /= 2` |

**Example:**
```python
total_sales = 100
total_sales += 50  # new total = 150
```

### 5. Membership Operators

| Operator | Meaning | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `in` | True if value is present | `5 in numbers` |
| `not in` | True if value is not present | `10 not in numbers` |

**Example:**
```python
products = ["apple", "banana", "orange"]
if "apple" in products:
    print("Product available")
```

## Expressions

An expression is a combination of operators and operands that is evaluated to produce a value.

### 1. Constant Expressions
Fixed values only. Used to store fixed values like thresholds or constants.

```python
x = 15 + 1.3
print(x)  # Output: 16.3
```

### 2. Arithmetic Expressions
Combine numbers and arithmetic operators to perform calculations.

```python
sales = 40
returns = 12
total_sales = sales + returns  # Addition
difference = sales - returns   # Subtraction
product = sales * returns      # Multiplication
average = sales / returns      # Division
```

### 3. Integral Expressions
Produce integer results. Used in categorical data calculations.

```python
a = 13
b = 12.0
c = a + int(b)  # Convert float to int
print(c)  # Output: 25
```

### 4. Floating Expressions
Produce decimal values (float).

```python
a = 13
b = 5
c = a / b
print(c)  # Output: 2.6
```

### 5. Relational Expressions
Compare values using comparison operators and return `True` or `False`.

```python
a, b, c, d = 21, 13, 40, 37
result = (a + b) >= (c - d)
print(result)  # Output: True
```

### 6. Logical Expressions
Combine multiple conditions using logical operators to produce `True` or `False`.

```python
age = 20
made_purchase = True
eligible = (age > 18) and made_purchase  # Check if both conditions are true
print("Eligible:", eligible)  # Output: Eligible: True
```

### 7. Combinational Expressions
Combine different types of expressions in one.

```python
a = 16
b = 12
total = a + b  # Arithmetic expression
is_large = total > 25  # Comparison expression
print("Total:", total)  # Output: 28
print("Is total > 25?", is_large)  # Output: True
```

## Conditional Statements

Conditional statements execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions. They control the flow of a program.

### 1. if Statement
Evaluates a condition and executes code if the condition is true.

```python
sale = 1200
if sale > 1000:
    print("High value sale")
# Output: High value sale
```

### 2. if-else Statement
Runs one block of code if condition is true, another if false.

```python
age = 10
if age <= 12:
    ticket = 0
else:
    ticket = 5
print(ticket)  # Output: 0
```

**Ternary/Shorthand:**
```python
age = 10
ticket = 0 if age <= 10 else 5
```

### 3. elif Statement
Runs several mutually exclusive conditions. If the first condition is correct, the rest are skipped.

```python
age = 25
if age <= 12:
    group = "Child"
elif age <= 19:
    group = "Teenager"
elif age <= 35:
    group = "Young adult"
else:
    group = "Adult"
print(group)  # Output: Young adult
```

### 4. Nested if Statement
Used when there's a need for a sub-check. Two conditions must be true for the block to run.

```python
age = 70
is_member = True
if age >= 60:
    if is_member:
        discount = 0.30
    else:
        discount = 0.20
else:
    discount = 0.0
print(discount)  # Output: 0.3
```

---

## Loops

Loops repeat actions efficiently. In data analytics, loops are used to go through each row, calculate totals, create new features, or perform checks.

### 1. for Loop
Iterates over a sequence (list, tuple, string, set, dict, range, etc.). Repeats a block once per item.

```python
# List of sales values
sales = [100, 250, 400]
total = 0

# Loop through each sale and add to total
for s in sales:
    total += s
print(total)  # Output: 750
```

### 2. while Loop
Executes a block of statements repeatedly until a condition is satisfied.

```python
batches = 3
cnt = 0
while cnt < batches:
    print("Process batch", cnt+1)
    cnt += 1
# Output: Process batch 1, 2, 3
```

### 3. Nested Loops
A loop inside another loop. Used when processing 2-dimensional structures.

```python
products = ["P1", "P2"]
regions = ["R1", "R2", "R3"]
pairs = []

for p in products:
    for r in regions:
        pairs.append((p, r))
print(pairs)
# Output: [('P1', 'R1'), ('P1', 'R2'), ('P1', 'R3'), ('P2', 'R1'), ('P2', 'R2'), ('P2', 'R3')]
```

### Loop Control Statements

| Statement | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `continue` | Skip to the next iteration |
| `break` | Exit the loop immediately |
| `pass` | Do nothing (placeholder) |

## Functions and I/O

### Functions

Functions are blocks of organized, reusable code that perform a single, related action. They help break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts.

**Defining a Function:**
```python
def function_name(parameters):
    # code block
    return value
```

**Example:**
```python
def calculate_total(sales, tax_rate):
    tax = sales * tax_rate
    total = sales + tax
    return total

result = calculate_total(1000, 0.08)
print(result)  # Output: 1080.0
```

### I/O (Input/Output)

I/O means reading data or writing data, such as reading files, writing files, or getting user input.

**Reading a file:**
```python
with open("data.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
```

**Writing to a file:**
```python
with open("output.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, Data Analytics!")
```

**User input:**
```python
name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
```

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Customer Segmentation
```python
customers = [
    {"name": "Alice", "total_spent": 500},
    {"name": "Bob", "total_spent": 2500},
    {"name": "Charlie", "total_spent": 1200}
]

for customer in customers:
    if customer["total_spent"] > 2000:
        segment = "VIP"
    elif customer["total_spent"] > 1000:
        segment = "Premium"
    else:
        segment = "Regular"
    print(f"{customer['name']}: {segment}")
```

### Example 2: Sales Analysis
```python
monthly_sales = [12000, 15000, 14500, 18000, 16500]
target = 15000

for month, sales in enumerate(monthly_sales, 1):
    status = "Above" if sales >= target else "Below"
    print(f"Month {month}: ${sales} - {status} target")
```

### Example 3: Data Cleaning
```python
raw_data = ["  apple ", "BANANA", "Orange  "]
cleaned_data = [item.strip().title() for item in raw_data]
print(cleaned_data)  # Output: ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Orange']
```
